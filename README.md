My 15th assignment! This project is a quick exploration of what classes can do to wrap up everything concering a concept such as "vehicles" into as compact and portable a package as possible.

I took a bit of a break over the last couple days between this assignment and the last to really hammer down working with OOP in python and I think I benefitted a lot from doing so. I used things I learned messed with generating different objects and stretching what I could do with them, so that by the time I did this assignment I felt very comfortable with it.
